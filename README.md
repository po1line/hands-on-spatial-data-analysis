# üåé Hands on spatial data analysis for environmental research (with python)
This is a tutorial covering the most common topics of working with geospatial data using python. Geospatial data is now a must-tool for a broad range of environmental monitoring tasks, e.g.:
* land-use land cover classification and change detection <br>
* forest inventory <br>
* monitoring of the occurrence of pollution, for example, by oil, heavy metals <br>
* detection of fires and post-fire areas <br>
* anomaly detection (flooded lands, deadwood stands, pests outbreaks, invasive species distribution) <br>

Information from this tutorial is focused on the terrestrial ecosystems, however, approaches and main information is applicable to water ecosystems in general as well.

Currently example notebooks includes next themes, that could be navigated by choosing the branches of current repo: 

1) [Data download](https://github.com/po1line/Hands-on-spatial-data-analysis/tree/data-download) <br>
2) [Basics of rasters math and calculation of spectral indices](https://github.com/po1line/Hands-on-spatial-data-analysis/tree/data-vis)  <br>
3) *Processing of the raster data according to vector data (currently in work üèóüöß) *  <br>
* *acquisition of the spectral information in certain locations represented by points;*  <br>
* *calculation of basic statistics within polygons.* <br>

You can upload them locally to reproduce the steps or launch on Google Colab.
